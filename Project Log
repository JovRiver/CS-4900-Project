Commit 1:

  Added three planes for player movement testing. Also added collision physics for player interaction.
Attempted to create two ramps out of two of the planes but ran into issues with collision phyics. Still
unresolved. Sources for collision physics code is the same code used for the base plane currently in the
main code provided by Michael. Main purpose of this code is to get a better understanding of collision 
physics and object placement. No plans to use this code in final build.
